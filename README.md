## Title: Personal Fitness Analyst 
Team Members: Julia, Luis, Kiana, Joey

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aroojanwarkhan/fitness-data-trends

Have you ever wondered if being active actually made you feel more or less active, or how it affected your everyday life? With the data we observed from an individual who calculated their activity status for three months using an app we are able to look at his activeness, mood, sleep, calories, and steps to answer some of those questions.

## RESEARCH QUESTION
- Does Working Out Help a Person Become More Active Overall?
- Can the amount of sleep you get affect your mood?
- Can the calories burned affect your mood?
- Does The Amount Of Steps Affect Your Feeling Of Activeness?
- Can Mood Affect The Amount Of Steps You Take In A Day?
